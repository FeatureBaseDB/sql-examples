# FeatureBase SQL: Game Analytics

## Overview

This folder has four CSV files with take data that is modeled after what a small live service video game might track in order to measure user engagement and quality of game mechanics. You should be able to run the .sql file in ''fbsql'' or run the command in the FeatureBase Cloud UI.

## Data Import

The data is stored remotely, but I have included a copy of the data in this folder.

## Running Queries

Open ''fbsql'', connect to your database, and run the following:
```
\include <absolute path>/run.sql
```
