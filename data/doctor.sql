They structure information as directed, labeled graphs, with nodes representing entities and edges representing relationships between these entities. In the context of unstructured data in data lakes, nodes could represent key terms or sections of text, while edges could represent the relationships between these elements. By applying SKGs to unstructured data, we can label and structure the data, facilitating more sophisticated analysis and insight extraction.\n\nIn the context of FeatureBases solution, the B-tree index can be used to accelerate the search of vectors, enabling quick and efficient access to relevant data. The real power of the B-tree index emerges when its used in conjunction with SKGs to filter the vector space by features extracted from the unstructured data. By doing this, FeatureBase can narrow down the search space and significantly reduce the time it takes to find the most relevant vectors. This makes the process of extracting valuable insights from unstructured data faster and more efficient. Integrating Semantic Knowledge Graphs, vector support, and customizable User Defined Functions (UDFs), FeatureBase enables more sophisticated data analysis and empowers businesses to extract meaningful insights from their data lakes.');
