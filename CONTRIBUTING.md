## Contributing to SQL Examples

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the SQL Examples repository! We appreciate your support in making this collection of SQL queries even better. Here are some guidelines to help you get started with contributing to SQL Examples:

1. Familiarize Yourself with the Project:
   - Take some time to explore the SQL Examples repository. You can clone or download it to your local machine.
   - Read the existing SQL files in the `data/` directory to understand the types of queries and the structure of the examples.

2. Choose an Area to Contribute:
   - Identify an area where you'd like to contribute, such as adding new SQL query examples, improving existing examples, or organizing the queries into categories.
   - If you have any new ideas or query patterns that are not yet covered, feel free to propose them as well.

3. Create or Update SQL Files:
   - Create a new SQL file in the `data/` directory for your new query example. Alternatively, choose an existing SQL file to update.
   - You can also use the `database.py` file in the `lib` directory to write out new SQL queries you send FeatureBase Cloud.
   - Make sure the SQL query is well-formatted, readable, and represents a specific query pattern or scenario.
   - If you're updating an existing SQL file, ensure that the changes align with the purpose and intent of the example.

4. Check for Proper Semicolon Usage:
   - Each line in the SQL files should end with a semicolon (;) unless it is a comment line starting with "--" or a blank line.
   - To ensure consistency, review the end of each line (excluding comment lines and blank lines) and add a semicolon if it is missing.

5. Test the SQL Files:
   - Ensure that the SQL files are syntactically correct and can be executed without errors.
   - You can use [FeatureBase Cloud](https://cloud.featurebase.com/) to execute the queries and verify their functionality.

6. Submitting Your Contribution:
   - Fork the SQL Examples repository to your GitHub account.
   - Create a new branch with a descriptive name for your contribution.
   - Commit your changes to the branch, providing clear and concise commit messages.
   - Push the branch to your forked repository and submit a pull request to the main SQL Examples repository.
   - In the pull request description, explain the changes you made and their significance.

7. Review and Collaboration:
   - Your contribution will be reviewed by the project maintainers.
   - Be responsive to any feedback or suggestions provided by the maintainers or other contributors.
   - Collaborate with the maintainers to address any requested changes or improvements to your contribution.

8. Licensing:
   - By contributing to the SQL Examples repository, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same license as the repository. The license details can be found in the repository's LICENSE file.
